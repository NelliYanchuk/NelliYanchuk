![I am a DataBase Engineer/ ETL Developer](https://i.postimg.cc/NMzYFPWc/dataengineer.jpg))

ðŸŒŸ I am a cheerful and open-minded individual who values diversity and enjoys working in collaborative environments. 
ðŸŒŸ I am comfortable handling both repetitive tasks and managing multiple responsibilities at once. Cooperation with team members is essential to me, as I prefer not to work in isolation. 
ðŸŒŸ Although I am adaptable, I prefer working with established frameworks rather than being the first to introduce and implement entirely new development environments.

Skills: AWS/ ETL/ SQL/ Python/ Docker/ Git/ Linux/ Matillion/ Pandas/ BitBucket/ Jira/ SSIS/ PostgreSQL/ MS SQL Server/ AginityWorkbench/ DBeaver/ Data Migration Service

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
